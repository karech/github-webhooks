# Python GitHub Webhooks Framework

Simple and lightweight micro framework for quick integration with [GitHub
webhooks][1].  
It's based on [FastAPI][3] and [pydantic][4], nothing more!
Async and mypy friendly! 



## Installation
Just add `github-webhooks-framework` package.   
Example: 
* `pip install github-webhooks-framework`
* `poetry add github-webhooks-framework`


## Example
Create file `example.py` and copy next code:
```python
import uvicorn
from pydantic import BaseModel

from github_webhooks import create_app
from github_webhooks.schemas import WebhookCommonPayload


# WebhookCommonPayload is based on pydantic.BaseModel
class PullRequestPayload(WebhookCommonPayload):
    class Pull(BaseModel):
        title: str
        url: str
    
    action: str
    pull_request: Pull
    

# Initialize Webhook App
app = create_app()


# Register webhook handler:
#   `pull_request` - name of an event to handle
#   `PullRequestPayload` - webhook payload will be parsed into this model
@app.hooks.register('pull_request', PullRequestPayload)
async def handler(payload: PullRequestPayload) -> None:
    print(f'New pull request {payload.pull_request.title}')
    print(f'  link: {payload.pull_request.url}')
    print(f'  author: {payload.sender.login}')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # start uvicorn server
    uvicorn.run(app)
```
  
 
### Let's have detailed overview. 

We start by defining payload [Model][5] to parse incoming [Pull Request Body][6]. 
```python
class PullRequestPayload(WebhookCommonPayload):
    class Pull(BaseModel):
        title: str
        url: str
    
    action: str
    pull_request: Pull
```
In this example we only want to get `action`, `pull_request.title` and `pull_request.url` from payload.  
By subclassing `WebhookCommonPayload` model will automatically get `sender`, `repository` and `organization` fields.


Next - we are creating ASGI app (based on FastAPI app)
```python
app = create_app()
```
Optionally we can provide here `secret_token` [Github Webhook secret][7]
```python
app = create_app(secret_token='super-secret-token')
```

And time to define our handler
```python
@app.hooks.register('pull_request', PullRequestPayload)
async def handler(payload: PullRequestPayload) -> None:
    print(f'New pull request {payload.pull_request.title}')
    print(f'  link: {payload.pull_request.url}')
    print(f'  author: {payload.sender.login}')
```

We are using here `@app.hooks.register` deco, which accepts 2 arguments:
* `event: str` - name of webhook event
* `payload_cls: pydantic.BaseModel` - pydantic model class to parse request, subclassed from `pydantic.BaseModel` 
or `WebhookCommonPayload`.

And our handler function must be any of this signatures:  
```python
async def handler(payload: PullRequestPayload) -> None:
    ...
```
```python
async def handler(payload: PullRequestPayload, headers: WebhookHeaders) -> Optional[str]:
    # `headers` will be WebhookHeaders model with Github Webhook headers parsed.
    ...
```  


And the last - let's launch it.  
For example with uvicorn  
```shell
uvicorn example:app
```
Webhook will be available on http://localhost:8000/hook

That's it!
Now you have a webhook server, which can handle incoming Github Webhook requests.
